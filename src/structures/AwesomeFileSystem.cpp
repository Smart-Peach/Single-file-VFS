/* TODO: EXTENDS FileSystem.cpp

Create file:
    - Create Inode
    - Add Inode to i-list
    - Add Inode to Superblock (update fields in Superblock --> it will be in Superblock.cpp)
    (I guess we don't need to open bin file here, because in description of "AddInode" in InodeMap it should write to bin file)
